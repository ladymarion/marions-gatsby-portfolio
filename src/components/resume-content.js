By the time she left the Bridges she was responsible for both the Tennis and Rec Centre and Sports Centre accounts. Marion reported to the directors of both facilities with designs for seasonal event catalogs, flyers for print and web, sale advertisements and informational brochures. She maintained the website content for both facilities, created web banners, uploaded flyers, and managed Sports Centre email marketing blasts. She loved working for The Bridges, and continued to work for them independently for years after she moved away.</p>
